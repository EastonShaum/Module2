# Module2 - Easton Shaum's Portfolio website
 ## The challenge for this week was about creating our own portfolio webiste from sratch so that we can add to it was the bootcamp goes on and we have done more projects. I decided to follow closely to the example and then have the ability to change it and modify it in the future to what I might want or what looks better
 Here is the link for my website - https://eastonshaum.github.io/Module2/
